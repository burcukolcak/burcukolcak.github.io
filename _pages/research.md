My research spans democratization, authoritarian regimes, local politics, federalism, intergovernmental relations, public opinion, political communication, and social media and politics. I am interested in the application of experimental methods, quantitative text analysis, machine learning, and geospatial analysis in my own research and in social science more broadly.
