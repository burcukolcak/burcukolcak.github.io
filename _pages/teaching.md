### Diversity in Data Program (Rutgers Libraries) 

Since October 2021, I am a diversity in data graduate specialist at Rutgers Libraries, where I conduct independent research on data practices that reflect systemic racism, unconscious bias, and marginalization of underrepresented groups, best practices to overcome these problems, and similar topics. I present my findings to the Rutgers Community by delivering workshops. I also deliver workshops on quantitative and computational methods for social science research.
