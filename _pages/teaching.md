### Diversity in Data Program (Rutgers Libraries) 

Since October 2021, I am a diversity in data graduate specialist at Rutgers Libraries, where I investigate data bias and data collection issues with disparate impacts by race, ethnicity, and identity. I present my findings to the Rutgers Community by delivering talks and workshops.
