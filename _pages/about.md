Welcome! 

<br/> <br/>

I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Rutgers University. I am broadly interested in comparative politics, computational social science, and social media and politics.

<br/> <br/>

I hold a master's in political theory from the London School of Economics, and a master's in philosophy from the Middle East Technical University.
